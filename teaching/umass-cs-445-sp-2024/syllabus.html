    <h2> Course Details </h2>
    <p>
    This course is an introduction to the efficient management of large-scale data. Data has become more central to many computer systems and applications. This course will provide a foundation for building, managing, and constructing systems that handle large quantities of complex data. The course will focus on understanding the internals of the data management systems, to give students insight into how to structure the data itself and how to efficiently query large sets of data. As part of this course, you will be exposed to:
    <ul>
      <li>
	Principles for representing information as structured data
      </li>
      <li>
	Query languages for analyzing and manipulating structured data
      </li>
      <li>
	Core systems principles that enable efficient computation on large data sets
      </li>
      <li>
	Data modeling, SQL, query optimization, concurrency control in relational databases
      </li>
      <li>
	Semi-structured data (XML, JSON)
      </li>
      <li>
	Distributed data processing paradigms such as MapReduce and Spark
      </li>
    </ul>
